## *Introduction To Machine Learning*

### **1. What is Artificial intelligence (AI)?**
Artificial intelligence (AI) is a branch Of Computer Science that is concerned with building<br> smart and intelligent Machines.

---> Non intelligent Machines <br>
  Non intelligent Machines are not capable of making decisions or learning from experience <br>
  examples:- Bike , Watch 

---> Intelligent Machines <br>
  Intelligent Machines that can accomplish its specific task in the presence of uncertainty and variability in its environment. <br>
  example:- Google Assistant or Tesla Car

### **2. What is Machine learning ?**
Machine Learning is a technique to implement AI that can learn from the data by themselves without being explicity programmed.

### **3. What is Deep learning** 
 Deep learning is a subset of ML that uses Artifical neural network to learn from the data
