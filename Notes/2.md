### **Types Of Machine Learning are** <br>
  - **Supervised Learning**.
  - **Unsupervised Learning**.
  - **Reinforcement Learning**.

### **What is Supervised Learning**?
In Supervised learning, the machine learning algorithm learns from labelled data

### **What is Unsupervised Learning**?
In Unsupervised learning, the machine learning algorithm learns from unlabelled data

### **What is Reinforcement learning**?
Reinforcement learning is an area of Machine learning concerned with how intelligent agents take actions in an environment to maximum its rewards.
there are four aspects:<br>
    - Environment<br>
    - Agent<br>
    - Action<br>
